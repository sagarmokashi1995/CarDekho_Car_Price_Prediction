# Car-Price-Prediction

Dataset contains some data of Car Dekho company.
This model will predict selling price of a car based on the previous price with used years and other features.

I have created 2 models one with RandomForestRegressor and another with XGBoostRegressor. Out of which RandomForestRegressor was working very well and giving gaussian distribution shape for data distribution. Hence, that was used for as a final model.

The same application has been deployed on heroku: https://car-dekho-car-price-prediction.herokuapp.com/
